# cyclistic-case-study
Working in the marketing analysis team for Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I was tasked to analyze a yearâ€™s worth of bike ride data to look into how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will come up with marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
